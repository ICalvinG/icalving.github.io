<h3>Alternate Website</h3>
<p>This <a href="http://allanz-onepiece.blogspot.com/p/straw-hat-pirates-crew-statistics_23.html">website</a> is a better than mine because there is much more information about the crew. Also the website centered all the important information and applied links to the sides. The statistics also come with images of the members right next to their bio so you can clearly see who they are when you are reading about them. Their bios also go more in depth about the character so you can understand more about them besides the small facts I have put into my website.</p>
